# svg-logo-maker

## Description
This app is an SVG logo maker which uses node.js to create various SVG logos for the user to use on future web development projects.

## Usage
Open the index.js file in an integrated terminal in VScode.  Run the command 'node index.js' and press enter.  The user will be met with a series of prompts asking the text content, text color, shape, and shape color of their SVG logo.  Upon completion of the prompts an SVG file will be created with the specified shape, color, and text that the user chose.  Open the newly created 'logo.svg' file in the browser by clicking 'Go Live' on the bottom right of your VScode to view your newly created SVG logo. 

## Installation 
The user must have node.js installed on their local machine in order to use this application.
