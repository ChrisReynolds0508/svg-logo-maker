# svg-logo-maker

## Description
This app is an SVG logo maker which uses node.js to create various SVG logos for the user to use on future web development projects.

## Usage
Open the index.js file in an integrated terminal in VScode.  Run the command 'node index.js' and press enter.  The user will be met with a series of prompts asking the shape, shape color, text, and text color of their SVG logo.  Upon completion of the prompts an SVG file will be created with the specified shape, color, and text that the user chose.  A preview of the SVG content can be viewed by right clicking on the logo.svg file and click 'Preview SVG'. 

## Installation 
The user must have node.js installed on their local machine in order to use this application.
